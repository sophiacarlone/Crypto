CS456/CS556/MA456 Cryptography Assignment 3 (Spring 2022)
Submit this plaintext unencrypted by email along with all the ElGamal keys used for the encryption.
Write a simple socket-based chat program that uses ElGamal with DES/AES (your choice) in a programming

DES/AES. Implement a system that encrypts single ASCII characters. Arrange an online demonstration of 
your program. You may work in groups of three.
