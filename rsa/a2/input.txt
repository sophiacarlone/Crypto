You are reading the plaintext of our second assignment in cryptography.
For this assignment, implement your own RSA cryptosystem for text files.
Then, re-encrypt this plaintext with your own RSA keys and then submit the
encrypted text file via email along with the RSA secret keys (which are the
RSA modulus and RSA secret decryption exponent used). You may implement RSA
in any programming language of your choice. Submit the source for your RSA
program in a separate compressed file by email.
